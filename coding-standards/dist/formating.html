<div class="lang-ex">
<h5 id="php">PHP</h5>
<p>For files that contain only PHP code, the closing tag (”?&gt;”) is never permitted. It is not required by PHP, and omitting
it prevents the accidental injection of trailing white space into the response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Important: Inclusion of arbitrary binary data as permitted by __HALT_COMPILER() is prohibited from PHP
files in any project or files derived from them. Use of this feature is only permitted for some installation scripts.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h2 id="indentation">Indentation</h2>
<p>Indentation should consist of 4 spaces. Tabs are not allowed.</p>
<p>Regarding Python and Coffee Script, indentation shall remain to 2 spaces. Tabs are also not allowed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This limits can be changed by project references.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="maximum-line-length">Maximum Line Length</h1>
<p>The target line length is 100 characters. That is to say, developers should strive keep each line of their code under 100
characters where possible and practical. However, longer lines are acceptable in some circumstances. The maximum length
of any line of code is 140 characters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This limits can be changed by project references.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="line-termination">Line Termination</h1>
<p>Line termination follows the Unix text file convention. Lines must end with a single linefeed (LF) character. Linefeed
characters are represented as ordinal 10, or hexadecimal 0x0A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not use carriage returns (CR) as is the convention in Apple OS’s (0x0D) or the carriage return - linefeed
combination (CRLF) as is standard for the Windows OS (0x0D, 0x0A).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>For files that contain <strong>only code</strong>, the closing tag is never permitted (when programming language allows it). I.e. it
is not required by <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>, and omitting it prevents the accidental injection of trailing white space
into the response.</p>
<h3 id="editorconfig">EditorConfig</h3>
<p>In order to standardize all IDE configurations, we recommend the <a href="http://editorconfig.org/">Editorconfig</a> standard.</p>
<p><strong>What is EditorConfig?</strong></p>
<p>EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor
plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily
readable and they work nicely with version control systems.</p>
<p>Further more, the use of the the following <a href="/.editorconfig">.editorconfig</a> (as a base) is mandatory in any project
developed by <a href="http://company.foo/">Foo Company LTD</a>.</p>
