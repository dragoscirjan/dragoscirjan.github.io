<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Strictly adhere to the agreed-upon style guide listed below. The general principle is to develop DRY (Don&#39;t Repeat
Yourself) CSS (LESS, SCSS/SASS), built around reusable components and patterns.</p>
<!-- * All code should look like a single person has typed it.
* Don't try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.
* When building a component, always start by looking at existing patterns.
* Break down complex components until they are made up of simple components.
* Save your complex components as patterns so they can be easily reused.
* Build your component as a mixin which outputs _optional_ css. -->
