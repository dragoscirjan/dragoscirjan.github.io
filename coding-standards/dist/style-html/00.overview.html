<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Strictly adhere to the agreed-upon style guide listed below. The general principle is to develop DRY (Don&#39;t Repeat
Yourself) SCSS, built around reusable components and patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>All code should look like a single person has typed it.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.</li>
<li>When building a component, always start by looking at existing patterns.</li>
<li>Break down complex components until they are made up of simple components.</li>
<li>Save your complex components as patterns so they can be easily reused.</li>
<li>Build your component as a mixin which outputs <em>optional</em> css.</li>
</ul>
